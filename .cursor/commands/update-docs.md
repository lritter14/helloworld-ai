# update-docs

Summarize all changes in this branch. Using that summary as context, update the main README.md and every AGENTS.md file in the repository. Ensure that each internal package directory (such as internal/handlers, internal/service, internal/storage, internal/llm, internal/http, internal/config) has its own concise, up-to-date AGENTS.md file documenting the key architectural patterns, role of the layer, and any conventions or changes relevant to this branch.
