{"test_case_id": "test_001", "question": "What are the key tips for LeetCode interviews in Golang?", "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key tips for LeetCode interviews in Golang:\n\n1. **Avoid Sorting Built-in Functions**: Unlike some other languages, Go does not have built-in string sort functions. This means that if you are dealing with sorting tasks in LeetCode interviews, you need to implement your own sorting logic, typically using sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or even a simple Bubble Sort.\n\n2. **Handle Single Element in Strings**: In Go, a string is essentially a sequence of bytes, so handling a single element in a string is equivalent to handling a single byte. This means you should treat each character of the string as a separate byte.\n\n3. **Custom Sorting of Slices**: If your LeetCode problem involves sorting a slice, you should implement your own custom sort function, as there is no built-in string sort in Go.\n\n4. **Designing Hash Maps**: When designing a hash map in Go, consider the following aspects:\n   - **Choosing a Hash Function**: Go does not have a built-in hash function, so you should implement one according to the problem requirements.\n   - **Handling Collisions**: Go uses chaining or open addressing to handle collisions. Ensure you understand how these techniques work and implement them correctly.\n   - **Resizing the Underlying Array**: When the load factor (the ratio of the number of elements to the array's capacity) exceeds a certain threshold, resize the underlying array to maintain efficient performance.\n\n5. **Frequency Counting, Finding Unique Elements, and Caching**: Hash maps are excellent for problems involving counting elements, finding unique items, and implementing caches. Be familiar with common use cases such as:\n   - **Frequency Counting**: Count the occurrences of each element in a given array or string.\n   - **Finding Duplicates or Uniqueness**: Detect if any duplicates exist in a given array or string.\n   - **Implementing Caches**: Use hash maps to implement LRU (Least Recently Used) caches.\n\n6. **Implement Two-Sum Type Problems**: For problems involving finding pairs of numbers that sum up to a specific target, hash maps can be used efficiently. By storing one number and using a map to check if the complement (target - current number) has already been seen, you can solve these problems in O(n) time.\n\n7. **Understand Hash Tables**: Hash tables are crucial for many coding interview questions and real-world applications. They allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Key considerations include:\n   - **Choosing an Appropriate Hash Function**: Select a hash function that distributes keys uniformly across the hash table.\n   - **Handling Collisions**: Use chaining or open addressing to manage collisions.\n   - **Resizing the Underlying Array**: Resize the array when the load factor becomes too high to maintain performance.\n\nThese tips should help you tackle LeetCode problems more effectively in Golang.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b", "chunk_index": 0}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/LeetCode Tips.md", "heading_path": "## Golang Tips & Oddities", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b > ### Go Specific pointers", "chunk_index": 5}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "9301c65c1db88a7ce2470c3fb8a4738a", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.7284557223320007, "score_final": 0.6299189925193787, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b\nLink: Array cheatsheet for coding interviews | Tech Interview HandbookGo: Go: Arrays and Slices, a deep dive."}, {"chunk_id": "05daa48756b23175348e8aa3d272c96c", "rel_path": "Software/LeetCode Tips.md", "heading_path": "## Golang Tips & Oddities", "rank": 2, "score_vector": 0.7167543768882751, "score_final": 0.6217280626296997, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Golang Tips & Oddities\nno built in string sort\nsingle element in a string is a byte\ncustom sorting of slice"}, {"chunk_id": "c50f25734bfe76b8890c16c17957e91b", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "rank": 3, "score_vector": 0.6705594062805176, "score_final": 0.5893915891647339, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Designing a HashMap\nDesign HashMap -

The context mentions the possibility of turning on and off the auto-sync cluster input for deploy and terminate actions.\n\n7. **Scaling Actions:**\n   - Users should have to opt into scaling, and there are questions about whether users should be required to use a dedicated scaling page or opt into scaling.\n\n8. **Flywheel CLI:**\n   - The context mentions that the Fly CLI tool is used to deploy Lambda-based apps on Rapid, and all deployments, including their logs, appear on the Rapid UI.\n\n9. **Secure Writes and Reads:**\n   - Secure writes and reads for Flywheel Key-Value Pairs in Consul are implemented to improve security for all deployments.\n\n10. **EKS Deployment:**\n    - There is a need to connect Flywheel to the existing workflow that allows users to deploy to EKS.\n\nThese points summarize the current issues with EKS deployment actions on Rapid and Flywheel.", "references": [{"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ### Current Issues", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic", "chunk_index": 0}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS Rollback and Scaling.md", "heading_path": "### Thoughts & Debugging Space", "chunk_index": 5}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/Key Accomplishments.md", "heading_path": "### Flywheel and Rapid", "chunk_index": 2}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "feff81a1eaaf43cb87427a1bad6a2a74", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ### Current Issues", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.8701549768447876, "score_final": 0.729108452796936, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Current Issues\nLogs on EKS deploy action are not streamed to the user\nLogs are messy when triggered on rapid, good when triggered with fly CLI\nStatus of actions on Rapid do not reflect status on Githu..."}, {"chunk_id": "f5180277c49832827bd2653787385618", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic", "rank": 2, "score_vector": 0.7904300689697266, "score_final": 0.6733010411262512, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "notion-id: adf465a5-8568-4c11-b921-d17ba0ab49ebbase: \"[[Fanatics.base]]\"cover: \"[[EKS and Rapid Config.jpeg]]\"Tags:\nfanatics\nWork\nbrainstormCreated: 2024-08-29T13:47:00\n\nTopic\n[!tip] 💡EKS Deployment A..."}, {"chunk_id": "9c3c850458a8b2f3a84ca76e6f19e34c", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS Rollback and Scaling.md", "heading_path": "### Thoughts & Debugging Space", "rank": 3, "score_vector": 0.7777438759803772, "score_final": 0.6644207239151001, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": " creation for production deployments in rapid?user should not be allowed to deploy in production from local but need to allow from github actions\nturn on and off autosynccluster input on deploy and te..."}, {"chunk_id": "2500164d074b051a297f4e8989c242b2", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design", "rank": 4, "score_vector": 0.7692967653274536, "score_final": 0.6585077047348022, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Feature Details & UI Design\n\nScaling\nQuestions\nShould we have users opt into scaling like we do on EC2 deployments?\nDo we want to add ‘scale’ as an actions on the main page for an application in Rapid..."}, {"chunk_id": "9aefbf447e167e15df19fbc19dc57c8d", "rel_path": "Cloud/Key Accomplishments.md", "heading_path": "### Flywheel and Rapid", "rank": 5, "score_vector": 0.7665132284164429, "score_final": 0.6565592288970947, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "help with load on Vault/Consul for deployment activities with a large number of EC2 instances.\nImplement hot-swap strategy, reducing non-prod deployment time in half for several hundred deployments da..."}, {"chunk_id": "0d553a81d75506289f9ac71c7a18eead", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKSFlywheel.md", "heading_path": "## LDAP authentication", "rank": 6, "score_vector": 0.7599976062774658, "score_final": 0.6519983410835266, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "LDAP authentication\nflywheel should know where the spec if for EKS application\nneed to pull users.yaml from artifactory"}, {"chunk_id": "58f5b9f2610abb22168de71c1c135765", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS Rollback and Scaling.md", "heading_path": "### Problem Statement", "rank": 7, "score_vector": 0.758476734161377, "score_final": 0.6509336829185486, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Problem Statement\nScaling and Rollback in EKS Deployments"}, {"chunk_id": "5a1eb862d8cde871c5fea535adf98403", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKSFlywheel.md", "heading_path": "## Nexus Platform & Flywheel", "rank": 8, "score_vector": 0.7541970610618591, "score_final": 0.6479379534721375, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Nexus Platform & Flywheel\nfly nexus deploy …\ncan support both eks and nexus to start\nnew CLI package with command nexus…2. developers use two command lines\nfly deploy could intelligently figure out wh..."}, {"chunk_id": "b4331d4f7924839d538f66d9c3943348", "rel_path": "Cloud/Intermediate Deployment Action.md", "heading_path": "# Problem statement", "rank": 9, "score_vector": 0.7503953576087952, "score_final": 0.6452767252922058, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Problem statement\nThe current deployment actions do not support the ability to add X% of instances in the new ASG instead of deploying all (N-1) instances simultaneously.

Hash tables are particularly useful for efficiently counting elements without needing to iterate through the entire collection multiple times.\n\n2. **Finding Duplicate or Unique Items**: Hash tables can be used to find duplicate items in a collection by storing each item in the hash table and checking for collisions, which indicate duplicate entries.\n\n3. **Implementing Caches (e.g., LRU Cache)**: Hash tables can be used to implement Least Recently Used (LRU) caches. The hash table stores the key-value pairs, where the key is the cache entry and the value is the associated data or reference to the data. The hash table also includes mechanisms to manage the eviction of the least recently used entries.\n\n4. **Two-Sum Type Problems**: These problems typically involve finding pairs of numbers in an array that sum up to a specific value. Hash tables can be used to achieve this efficiently by storing the complement of each number seen so far and checking if it exists in the hash table.\n\nThese use cases are directly mentioned in the provided context and are common in coding interview questions.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 0}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## Techniques > ### Pre-computation", "chunk_index": 11}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b", "chunk_index": 0}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "69502da0c400ee1dde6cb2fb502e1e0f", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.7822145819664001, "score_final": 0.6675502061843872, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Flexible key types (not limited to comparable types like in tree structures)\nIdeal for problems involving counting, finding unique elements, or caching\nCommon use cases in interviews:\nFrequency counti..."}, {"chunk_id": "8a20f28adf4243f67c61c814bdd24a96", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "rank": 2, "score_vector": 0.7032145261764526, "score_final": 0.6122502088546753, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09\n**Space-Time tradeoff: **traverse data, hash elements, and determining existence is now O(1)Hash tables are data structures that provide efficient key-v..."}, {"chunk_id": "c50f25734bfe76b8890c16c17957e91b", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "rank": 3, "score_vector": 0.7028467655181885, "score_final": 0.6119927763938904, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Designing a HashMap\nDesign HashMap - LeetCode\n[!note] 📌Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.\nImp"}, {"chunk_id": "f4735302253eb9ca62f7eb0385f60394", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## Techniques > ### Pre-computation", "rank": 4, "score_vector": 0.6739215850830078, "score_final": 0.591745138168335, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Pre-computation\n\nIndex as a hash key"}, {"chunk_id": "9301c65c1db88a7ce2470c3fb8a4738a", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b", "rank": 5, "score_vector": 0.6684980392456055, "score_final": 0.5879486203193665, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "notion-id: a643e602-d2c2-42c7-8493-d9a0edd0ac3b\nLink: Array cheatsheet for coding interviews | Tech Interview HandbookGo: Go: Arrays and Slices, a deep dive."}, {"chunk_id": "0fbd40cb5a6220897b944b9e3699191d", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/BST Traversal, Sets, & Maps.md", "heading_path": "# Closing Notes", "rank": 6, "score_vector": 0.6851176619529724, "score_final": 0.5795823931694031, "score_lexical": 0.3333333432674408, "text": "Closing Notes\nTrees are just one way of implementing sets and maps.

According to the provided context, the promotion process takes care of these traffic shifts in a seamless manner to provide a good user experience.

This is done by coordinating with cluster administrators to ensure that the EKS API can handle the increased traffic. The context suggests that cluster administrators might need to enable EKS API server autoscaling or adjust traffic limits to handle increased traffic during the promotion process.\n\nIn summary, the promotion workflow is handled by Argo CD within EKS, and it ensures the smooth traffic shifting between the old and new stacks, providing visibility to the users on the current state of the promotion process.", "references": [{"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design > ### Promote", "chunk_index": 4}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/Promote Argocd EKS.md", "heading_path": "### Problem Statement", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/ArgoCD Performance.md", "heading_path": "# Optimizing ArgoCD Performance and Scalability on Amazon EKS > ## Performance Tuning & Scaling of ArgoCD Components", "chunk_index": 23}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS Rollback and Scaling.md", "heading_path": "### Problem Statement", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKSFlywheel.md", "heading_path": "## Promote", "chunk_index": 2}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "079f9923c45732a1ffadd81dd101754c", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design > ### Promote", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.8239434361457825, "score_final": 0.6967604160308838, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Promote\nQuestions3.

{"test_case_id": "test_020", "question": "What are the key considerations when implementing a hash table?", "answer": "The key considerations when implementing a hash table, based on the provided context, are:\n\n1. **Choosing an appropriate hash function**: The hash function must map keys to indices in the underlying array in a way that minimizes collisions and maximizes efficiency.\n\n2. **Handling collisions**: This can be achieved through various methods such as chaining (where each array slot contains a linked list of entries that hash to the same index) or open addressing (where the hash table checks the next available slot until a free one is found).\n\n3. **Resizing the underlying array**: When the load factor (the ratio of elements to slots) reaches a certain threshold, the size of the array should be increased to maintain good performance.\n\n4. **Collision resolution strategies**: Different strategies for dealing with collisions are necessary to maintain the efficiency of the hash table. These strategies can significantly impact the performance, so choosing an appropriate one is important.\n\n5. **Space-time tradeoff**: Hash tables use more memory than simpler data structures like arrays, but they offer constant-time operations for key-value pairs, which can be more efficient for certain operations.\n\nThese considerations are crucial for the implementation and usage of hash tables in various applications, including interviews and real-world use cases.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## Techniques > ### Pre-computation", "chunk_index": 11}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 0}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/BST Traversal, Sets, & Maps.md", "heading_path": "# Closing Notes", "chunk_index": 9}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "69502da0c400ee1dde6cb2fb502e1e0f", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.7802767157554626, "score_final": 0.6661937236785889, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Flexible key types (not limited to comparable types like in tree structures)\nIdeal for problems involving counting, finding unique elements, or caching\nCommon use cases in interviews:\nFrequency counti..."}, {"chunk_id": "c50f25734bfe76b8890c16c17957e91b", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "rank": 2, "score_vector": 0.7535569667816162, "score_final": 0.6474898457527161, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Designing a HashMap\nDesign HashMap - LeetCode\n[!note] 📌Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.\nImp"}, {"chunk_id": "f4735302253eb9ca62f7eb0385f60394", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Array.md", "heading_path": "## Techniques > ### Pre-computation", "rank": 3, "score_vector": 0.7393532395362854, "score_final": 0.6375472545623779, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Pre-computation\n\nIndex as a hash key"}, {"chunk_id": "8a20f28adf4243f67c61c814bdd24a96", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "rank": 4, "score_vector": 0.7341786623001099, "score_final": 0.6339250802993774, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09\n**Space-Time tradeoff: **traverse data, hash elements, and determining existence is now O(1)Hash tables are data structures that provide efficient key-v..."}, {"chunk_id": "0fbd40cb5a6220897b944b9e3699191d", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/BST Traversal, Sets, & Maps.md", "heading_path": "# Closing Notes", "rank": 5, "score_vector": 0.719202995300293, "score_final": 0.6034421324729919, "score_lexical": 0.3333333432674408, "text": "Closing Notes\nTrees are just one way of implementing sets and maps.

{"test_case_id": "test_025", "question": "What are the steps to cook the Maple Mustard Pork Tenderloin?", "answer": "To cook the Maple Mustard Pork Tenderloin, follow these steps based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Make Marinade:** Whisk together apple cider vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce (or coconut aminos), maple syrup, whole grain mustard, and black pepper.\n\n2. **Marinate Pork:** Place the pork tenderloin in a large bag, pour the marinade over it, and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.\n\n3. **Prep Pork:** Remove the pork from the marinade, pat it dry, and let it sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve the marinade.\n\n4. **Prep Veggies:** Preheat the oven to 375°F. Toss the Brussels sprouts, onion, and apples with the leftover marinade and set aside.\n\n5. **Seal and Roast:** Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil in an oven-safe skillet. Season the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper. Sear the pork for about 1 minute on each side until browned. Remove the pork from the skillet, briefly, and add the veggies to the same skillet. Place the pork back on top or nestle it into the veggies.\n\n6. **Roast:** Roast the pork and veggies at 375°F for 30 to 40 minutes, until the veggies are tender and the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145°F.\n\n7. **Rest & Plate:** Remove the pork from the skillet, tent it with foil for 5 to 8 minutes.

{"test_case_id": "test_029", "question": "How do I sort a string in Golang?", "answer": "To sort a string in Golang, you can follow a similar approach to sorting a slice of integers or characters. However, Golang does not have a built-in string sort function. You can create your own sorting function or use the `sort` package which provides sorting functionality for various data types.\n\nHere is a simple example of sorting a string by converting it to a byte slice and then using the `sort` package:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"sort\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\ts := \"cba\"\n\tbyteSlice := []byte(s)\n\tsort.Slice(byteSlice, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn byteSlice[i] < byteSlice[j]\n\t})\n\tfmt.Println(string(byteSlice))\n}\n```\n\nThis code converts the string `\"cba\"` to a byte slice, sorts the byte slice in ascending order, and then converts the sorted byte slice back to a string. \n\nRemember that strings in Go are immutable, so you would need to create a new string to store the sorted result. \n\nAnother approach is to use a custom sorting function if you need more specific sorting criteria. However, for general string sorting, the above method using the `sort.Slice` function is a good starting point.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/LeetCode Tips.md",

{"test_case_id": "test_037", "question": "What is the design approach for implementing a HashMap from scratch?", "answer": "The design approach for implementing a HashMap from scratch involves several key steps and considerations based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The HashMap class should be initialized with an empty map to start with (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n2. **Insertion Operation**: The `put(int key, int value)` method should be implemented to insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists, the corresponding value should be updated (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n3. **Retrieval Operation**: The `get(int key)` method should return the value corresponding to the specified key, or -1 if the map contains no mapping for the key (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n4. **Removal Operation**: The `remove(int key)` method should remove the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n5. **Data Structure**: Implement the HashMap using an array of linked lists. The value is used to figure out what index to input at, and the linked list allows for constant removal time (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n6. **Key Handling**: The design should be flexible with key types, not limited to comparable types like in tree structures, and can be used for various applications such as counting, finding unique elements, or caching (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n7. **Hash Function**: Choosing an appropriate hash function is crucial, which can help minimize collisions and improve performance (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n8. **Collision Handling**: Methods such as chaining or open addressing should be considered to manage collisions effectively (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n9. **Resizing**: The underlying array should be resized when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold to maintain performance (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\n10. **Efficiency**: The implementation should aim for an `O(1)` average time complexity for the `put`, `get`, and `remove` operations, which can be achieved by the linked list-based structure used (Section: ## Designing a HashMap).\n\nBy following these design considerations and steps, a HashMap can be implemented from scratch to handle key-value pairs efficiently.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/concepts/APIs.md", "heading_path": "# Design", "chunk_index": 2}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/BST Traversal, Sets, & Maps.md", "heading_path": "# Closing Notes", "chunk_index": 9}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "chunk_index": 4}, {"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## notion-id: c482e919-91f7-46a6-a884-4fd170a33f09", "chunk_index": 1}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "c50f25734bfe76b8890c16c17957e91b", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/Hash Tables.md", "heading_path": "## Designing a HashMap", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.875847578048706, "score_final": 0.7330933213233948, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Designing a HashMap\nDesign HashMap - LeetCode\n[!note] 📌Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.\nImp"}, {"chunk_id": "92839101862e4bbd20c519ccd8ea7f26", "rel_path": "Software/concepts/APIs.md", "heading_path": "# Design", "rank": 2, "score_vector": 0.7203953266143799, "score_final": 0.6242766976356506, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Design\n"}, {"chunk_id": "0fbd40cb5a6220897b944b9e3699191d", "rel_path": "Software/Data Structures & Algorithms/BST Traversal, Sets, & Maps.md", "heading_path": "# Closing Notes", "rank": 3, "score_vector": 0.7267892956733704, "score_final": 0.6087525486946106, "score_lexical": 0.3333333432674408, "text": "Closing Notes\nTrees are just one way of implementing sets and maps.

{"test_case_id": "test_047", "question": "How do I handle custom sorting of slices in Golang?", "answer": "To handle custom sorting of slices in Golang, you can use the `sort` package which provides a way to sort slices. The `sort` package includes methods for sorting slices of various types, and you can customize the sorting behavior by implementing the `Less` function.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to custom sorting of slices in Golang:\n\n1. **Import the `sort` package**: The `sort` package is essential for sorting slices. It provides functions for sorting slices of comparable types.\n\n2. **Implement the `Less` function**: This function is used to compare two elements in the slice. It should return `true` if the first element should come before the second element in the sorted slice.\n\n3. **Use the `sort.Slice` function**: This function sorts the slice in place based on the `Less` function you provided.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating these steps:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"sort\"\n)\n\n// Define a custom type and implement the `Less` method.\ntype Person struct {\n\tName string\n\tAge  int\n}\n\nfunc (p Person) Less(i, j int) bool {\n\treturn p.Age < (*Person)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(p.Age) + uintptr(i)*unsafe.Sizeof(p.Age))) Age\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tpeople := []Person{\n\t\t{Name: \"Alice\", Age: 30},\n\t\t{Name: \"Bob\", Age: 25},\n\t\t{Name: \"Charlie\", Age: 35},\n\t}\n\n\tsort.Slice(people, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn people[i].Age < people[j].Age\n\t})\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Sorted by age:\", people)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `Person` struct and implement the `Less` method to compare `Age` values. Then, we sort the slice of `Person` objects by age using `sort.Slice`.\n\nIf you need to sort based on multiple criteria, you can implement a custom comparator function that takes the necessary slices and uses `sort.Slice` with a custom `Less` function that applies these comparisons in the desired order.\n\nRemember to use caution when using the `unsafe.Pointer` and `unsafe.Sizeof` functions as they can lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly. In practice, it’s often better to rely on the `sort` package and avoid these unsafe features.", "references": [{"vault": "personal", "rel_path": "Software/LeetCode Tips.md", "heading_path": "## Golang

{"test_case_id": "test_048", "question": "What is the relationship between account_map and loyalty_account datasets?", "answer": "The relationship between the account_map and loyalty_account datasets is primarily established through a series of joins. Specifically, the Spark job performs an inner join between the account_map and loyalty_account datasets using the hashed_email field. This join is expected to produce a 1:1 relationship between the two datasets. Furthermore, the account_map dataset is deduplicated by surrogate_account_key and hashed_email, ensuring that each unique combination of surrogate_account_key and hashed_email is represented exactly once. This deduplication process is critical for maintaining the integrity of the account_map dataset and for ensuring that the account_map and loyalty_account datasets are properly synchronized. The job also deduplicates the account_reverse_map by surrogate_account_key and hashed_email, keeping the record with the latest mapping_ts. Finally, the job performs an inner join with the verified_account dataset using fan_id, filtering to only include verified users. This join is used to translate fan_id to surrogate_account_key, as fan_id in account_map is not considered a reliable source.", "references": [{"vault": "work", "rel_path": "docs/Accounts & Loyalty Raw Data – Documentation (from EMR Spark job).md", "heading_path": "# Summary", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "docs/Accounts & Loyalty Raw Data – Documentation (from EMR Spark job).md", "heading_path": "# Summary > ## Open Questions / Logic to Verify > #### Questions", "chunk_index": 40}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "docs/Accounts & Loyalty Raw Data – Documentation (from EMR Spark job).md", "heading_path": "# Summary > ## Open Questions / Logic to Verify", "chunk_index": 38}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "docs/Accounts & Loyalty Raw Data – Documentation (from EMR Spark job).md", "heading_path": "# Summary > ## Open Questions / Logic to Verify", "chunk_index": 37}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "docs/Loyalty Datasets.md", "heading_path": "# Summary > ## Column Reference > ### account_map", "chunk_index": 5}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "61a4365d2ef506a139df45ecc32d72cd", "rel_path": "docs/Accounts & Loyalty Raw Data – Documentation (from EMR Spark job).md", "heading_path": "# Summary", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.7472318410873413, "score_final": 0.6430622935295105, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Summary\nThis document defines the design, datasets, transformations, and outputs of a Spark job that validates and corrects account-to-loyalty directory mappings.

{"test_case_id": "test_050", "question": "What are the considerations for the promote workflow UI design in EKS deployments?", "answer": "Based on the provided context, there are several considerations for the promote workflow UI design in EKS deployments:\n\n1. **UI Design Elements for Promote Process:**\n   - The UI design elements tied to the promote process should be predominantly on the Rapid release page. This allows users to monitor the traffic shifting process more effectively.\n   - Single deploy and promote actions should still be available on the main service page. This ensures a comprehensive view of the application's lifecycle management.\n\n2. **Traffic Management:**\n   - The user interface should provide clear feedback on the current stage of the promote process and the amount of traffic allocated to each cluster. This ensures transparency and helps users track the progress of the migration.\n\n3. **Promote Action:**\n   - The term \"promote\" should be updated to \"promote-canary\" to align better with the ArgoCD context.\n   - The action should be visually distinct and placed in a prominent location, such as the top of the page or in a section labeled \"Deployment Messages\" to highlight its significance.\n   - A final green message could be displayed to signify that the promote process is complete and the new version of the application is live.\n\n4. **Promote Canary Button:**\n   - The addition of a \"promote-canary\" button in the cluster details section could be considered. This button should be hidden or disabled when the application is fully deployed. This button would allow users to initiate a test promotion to a specific percentage of the traffic, which can provide a gradual transition and easier rollback in case of issues.\n\n5. **Consolidation with Existing Actions:**\n   - While scaling and deploying can be performed simultaneously in EKS and ArgoCD, separate actions should be maintained for consistency with the current ecosystem. This would mean having a distinct \"scale\" action on the main page.\n\n6. **Linking to Additional Tools:**\n   - The ArgoCD link should be included to provide users with additional resources and insights into the deployment process.\n   - A Kiali link should also be added to provide visibility into the application's state and performance.\n   - The integration with Consul should be improved to ensure seamless registration of EKS applications with Consul.\n\nThese considerations aim to enhance the user experience by providing clear, intuitive, and comprehensive information about the promote process and its stages in EKS deployments.", "references": [{"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design > ### Promote", "chunk_index": 4}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/Promote Argocd EKS.md", "heading_path": "### Problem Statement", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS Rollback and Scaling.md", "heading_path": "### Problem Statement", "chunk_index": 1}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design", "chunk_index": 3}, {"vault": "work", "rel_path": "Cloud/Promote Argocd EKS.md", "heading_path": "### Action Items", "chunk_index": 4}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "079f9923c45732a1ffadd81dd101754c", "rel_path": "Cloud/EKS and Rapid Config.md", "heading_path": "# Topic > ## Feature Details & UI Design > ### Promote", "rank": 1, "score_vector": 0.8317718505859375, "score_final": 0.7022402882575989, "score_lexical": 0.4000000059604645, "text": "Promote\nQuestions3.
